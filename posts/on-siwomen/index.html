issue of the magazine <em>Sports Illustrated for Women</em> in the mail. A sister
magazine to the renowned sports monthly <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, <em>SI for Women</em>
focused wholly on women’s sports, unlike any sports media (or women’s
magazine!) that I had ever seen. Every cover featured one or more women
athletes, and the magazine’s content covered an impressive variety of sports,
as well as relevant topics for athletes, such as strength training, proper
nutrition, and balancing training and life, all centered on women and their
stories. My aunt, a former college basketball player turned coach and my first
model of a woman athlete, signed me up for a subscription as a surprise when
the magazine debuted. I was absolutely thrilled. Every time an issue arrived I
read it cover to cover, multiple times.</p><figure><img src=/march-april-2001.jpg><figcaption><h4>Cover for the March/April 2001 issue, featuring Mia Hamm.</h4></figcaption></figure><p><em>SI for Women</em> was unfortunately short-lived, only in circulation from March 2000
until December 2002, for a total of 20 or so issues. But its tenure overlapped
with a critical time in my life: somewhere between the ages of 8 and 10, both
deeply in love with multiple sports and facing a fair amount of personal
turmoil. Around that time, my family was caring for multiple grandparents whose
health was in rapid decline. We moved houses (and schools) to accommodate my
great-grandmother’s permanent residence with us as her dementia progressed;
other grandparents would regularly stay with us for care as well. Budding body
image issues planted in earlier years began to crystallize as I approached
puberty, compounded by class culture shock from starting 5th grade in a new
school whose student body was generally much wealthier than my previous one.</p><p>Sports were a core part of my identity then, and they are now, too. Over the
course of my life, I’ve had many athletic pursuits, including, in more or less
chronological order from pre-K to my current age:</p><ul><li>soccer</li><li>softball</li><li>basketball</li><li>a variety of martial arts, from karate to MMA to krav maga</li><li>pole vaulting</li><li>track (400m, 100m hurdles, and 4x200m relay)</li><li>cross-country</li><li>rugby</li><li>yoga</li><li>hiking</li><li>backpacking</li><li>distance running (half-marathon and marathon)</li><li>trail running</li><li>powerlifting</li><li>bodybuilding</li><li>rollerblading</li><li>rollerskating</li><li>olympic weightlifting</li></ul><p>Still, if you had asked me until very
recently if I considered myself an athlete, I would’ve emphatically declined.
In environments with other athletes, I never felt I was a standout in the room.
At the same time, I’m generally athletic, somewhat coordinated, naturally very
strong, and relatively fast and explosive. None of these qualities have
anything to do with being an athlete, though; it was a matter of how much I
felt I deserved the title.</p><p>As a child, I had no qualms about calling myself an athlete, particularly in
soccer and basketball. I have been competitive for as long as I can remember,
and sports were a healthy outlet for my ruthlessness. Nothing made me feel more
powerful than being aggressive on the field or court and seeing fear in my
opponents’ eyes after they witnessed my strength and skill. At the same time,
sports taught me how to work with others, even in tough situations, and showed
me the value of dedicated practice both as an individual and a team. The nerdy
side of me loved indulging in discussions of strategy, plays, and technical
details; my favorite soccer skill to practice was the highly technical <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick>corner kick</a>.
Sports were also incredible for my self-esteem. Once, for a writing
class, I wrote a short story from the perspective of myself playing soccer as a
girl, and a reviewer commented that the unabashed self-confidence and positive
self-talk in the narrative was unbelievable from the perspective of an adult
woman. But that’s what playing sports did for me.</p><figure><img src=/soccer-celebration.jpg><figcaption><h4>Celebrating with my dad after a soccer game as a child.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>As I grew older, a combination of outside influences led me to gradually quit
sports, eventually leaving completely around the age of 15 for many years. As
these influences pushed me out of sport, I lost part of myself in the process,
including a fair amount of confidence and self-love that playing sports had
helped me to cultivate. By that time, <em>Sports Illustrated for Women</em> was no
longer in print, and I had stopped re-reading my issues.</p><p>Some contributing opinions that led me to leave sports were well-intentioned.
For example, I always excelled without much effort at school. Many adults
impressed upon me how much more important school was for my future than sports;
it would be great if I could go to college for soccer, but it would be better
to get an academic scholarship instead, which was in the cards for me. I
remember people telling me to never quit school; I don’t remember anyone
telling me it was important to stay in sports.</p><p>Misogyny, compulsive heterosexuality, and the particular fatphobia of the era
(the 2000s) contributed, too. Men of all ages made comments about my natural
strength — and my joy in showing it off — being unattractive, and I was
strongly conditioned to care about their opinions. My male peers, emboldened by
a culture that dismisses women’s athletics, told me that my athletic
accomplishments didn’t matter because I was a girl, or that I would never beat
boys at my sport. (I routinely took this on as a challenge and delighted in
proving them wrong.) As I got older, my body as well as my tomboy fashion
preferences seemed to invite comments about what athletes, and girls in
general, should look like. The idea of a single athletic body type is obviously
just plain wrong — one of the things I loved about <em>Sports Illustrated for
Women</em> was a regular feature where they highlighted how a variety of athletes’
bodies made them perfect for their sport!</p><figure><img src=/whats-my-sport.jpg alt="SI Women had a regular feature called &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s My Sport?&amp;rdquo;, which depicted an athlete and a clue about what sport she played. The featured asked &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; to guess what her sport was, with the answer revealed at the bottom. (The &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; were very often wrong, and I found them to be the least interesting part of this feature.)."><figcaption><p><strong>SI Women had a regular feature called &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Sport?&rdquo;, which depicted an athlete and a clue about what sport she played.

(The &ldquo;experts&rdquo; were very often wrong, and I found them to be the least interesting part of this feature.).</strong></p></figcaption></figure><p>Still, I didn’t have the “right” body to many people. From the time I
was a baby, I was usually larger than my peers (I was in the 97th percentile
for my weight at 3 years old), and I was mocked for my weight and size by
adults and children alike. As I approached puberty my body became the subject
of more and more discussion from fellow athletes and coaches, who would make
unsolicited comments about what I should or shouldn’t eat. I began to dread
visits to the doctor because my pediatrician would lecture me with unactionable
advice about “diet and exercise,” which I found especially frustrating given
that forms of exercise (soccer, basketball, martial arts, riding my bike daily)
were literally my favorite things to do. Looking back, I realize I began to
engage in disordered eating as far back as middle school. I remember deciding
to quit cross-country before high school because I was scared to wear the much
tighter, cropped spandex uniforms that the high school runners wore, for fear
of having to expose my stomach.</p><p>A particularly egregious example of fatphobia’s impact on my athletic career
and health was an incident in middle school basketball practice. While doing
full court sprints, I experienced the first of several tachycardiac attacks in
my life, in which my heart will race up to 220 bpm after a quick jump into
intense exercise, making me feel faint, or even like I am dying. I told my
coach that something was really wrong. She dismissed me, downplayed my
symptoms, and told me if I lost some weight, then maybe my heart wouldn’t beat
so fast when I was sprinting. I still occasionally experience these attacks
regardless of my current level of fitness and body weight — I had one most
recently when I was peaking to run my second marathon, in the best aerobic
fitness of my life.</p><p>In college, I slowly started to dip my feet back into the water of athletics. I
tried rugby, but experienced an onslaught of new awfulness from some people
around me — particularly fatphobia and homophobia, as much of the team was
queer. I left after a few months, even though I enjoyed the sport a lot. But I
slowly started running again. After graduating, I began attending group fitness
classes and found that I really liked the stress outlet they provided. But my
primary goals were centered on making myself smaller and were never about
athletic performance — after all, what was my sport? I was self-aware of how
much I had internalized the idea that I needed to make myself thinner and
wanted to have other goals, but that desire alone wasn’t enough to shake the
deep-rooted poison that made me want to shrink myself. I started lifting
weights (first powerlifting, then bodybuilding) to try to build muscle as a
countermeasure. Still, I was terrified of weight gain even as I gained muscle
and grew stronger.</p><p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, like many others I found myself turning
to the hobbies of my childhood for comfort and novelty, particularly in the
early days where I stayed home almost all the time. I bought a Lisa Frank
coloring book pack; I revived my love of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution>Dance Dance Revolution</a> by getting a
step pad and playing the open source clone <a href=https://www.stepmania.com/>StepMania</a>.</p><figure><img src=/lisa-frank.jpg><figcaption><h4>The Lisa Frank art pack that entertained me for much of the early pandemic.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>I didn’t feel comfortable
going to the gym anymore, so I sought alternate sources of outdoor athletic
stress relief, like rollerskating, rollerblading, and ramping up my regular
running schedule to train for a marathon. I even got a soccer ball, the first
one I had owned in more than a decade. Once I was vaccinated, I was eager to
get back to lifting weights, and I signed up for an olympic weightlifting gym
to try a strength sport that had caught my eye years before but had been too
intimidated to try.</p><p>The experience of finding the sport of olympic weightlifting was indescribably
magical; if you know me at all, you’ve heard me talk about it. In short,
olympic weightlifting involves competing in two lifts, both of which start with
a loaded barbell on the ground and end with the bar raised overhead. In the
snatch, the lifter does this in one fluid motion; in the clean and jerk, the
lifter first cleans the bar to their shoulders, pauses, then lifts the bar
overhead with the jerk. The goal is to lift as much weight as possible for both
lifts, and to do so requires strength, mobility, strong body awareness, mental
focus, and explosiveness. (Some of the best olympic weightlifters are former
competitors in gymnastics, a sport with similar demands.)</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qn1rhdYbPos style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="Kuo Hsing-Chun (Taiwan) snatch attempts at 2017 Weightlifting World Championships"></iframe></div><p><strong>In the snatch, the lifter begins by holding the bar with a wide grip. In one
motion, the lifter lifts the bar from the ground, generating enough height such that
they can pull themselves into a squat (either partial or full) underneath the bar and lock out
their arms straight and overhead. The lift is complete after the lifter has stood up with
the barbell, with their feet in line, in control of the bar.</strong></p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnK74hG1puE style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="Sarah Robles (USA) - 150 kg clean and jerk at 2017 USA Nationals"></iframe></div><p><strong>The clean and jerk is a two-part lift. In the clean, the lifter begins with a
narrower grip, lifting the bar from the ground, high enough such that they can
pull themselves underneath the bar into a &ldquo;front rack&rdquo; position, with the bar
resting on their shoulders. The lifter must stand up and cease motion before
beginning the jerk. In the jerk, the lifter dips and drives up with their legs
to generate force to send the bar overhead. The lifter must receive the bar
with their arms locked out overhead, which requires some bending of the legs in
the receiving position. The lifter can receive the bar in a squat, partial
squat, or split squat position; these refer to the
squat jerk, power jerk, and split jerk variations, respectively, with split
jerk being the most common style and the one depicted in this video. The lift
is complete when the lifter has stood up, with their feet in line, bar overhead
and in control.</strong></p><p>Weightlifting requires a lot of the nervous system because the athlete is lifting heavy
weight from the ground to overhead, using practically every muscle in the body,
in just a few seconds. Consequently, the practice rewards taking care of one’s
central nervous system through stress management, sleep, and good nutrition
(not depriving oneself of food!). Something I noticed immediately about the sport
was that there are excellent olympic lifters of all sizes — in fact, the people
who can lift the most weight are generally also those who weigh the most. The world&rsquo;s
treatment of fat people seems only marginally better now than I was a child,
but seeing athletes, particularly women, celebrated regardless of their body
size was very powerful.</p><p>Olympic lifting also deeply appeals to the analytical, curious side of me.
The olympic lifts are highly technical and in my opinion, extremely nerdy;
they can be endlessly analyzed for perfect technique, and lifters improve by
breaking these complex lifts down into smaller components and improving
strength and technique in specific positions. The sport connects my brain, my
natural strength, and the athleticism of my body in a way
that I’ve never experienced in any activity, athletic or
otherwise. I often think to myself how this sport feels exactly made for me.
It gave me a new set of goals to strive for in my fitness pursuits, ones based
on performance, consistency, and mental fortitude.</p><p>There was something special about the gym that I joined, too; the belief my
coach and my fellow lifters (mostly women) had in me and my potential in the
sport was invigorating. In my gym, I am celebrated for my strength and
accomplishments, and no one cares what I weigh or what I look like in
low-rise jeans. Olympic lifting and the community I found through it helped me
to reclaim my lost identity as an athlete, reconnecting me to a deep joy and
love for sport that is surely an innate part of me.
In the process, I found that I grew a desire to take up space,
love my natural strengths, and take care for my body rather than fighting against it.
At last, I revived the confidence and self-esteem I once had as that fearless girl on the
soccer field.</p><figure><img src=/happy-snatch.jpg alt="A potato-quality image of me extremely happy after a hard-earned snatch PR.

directed toward trans people in the United States, with a systematic focus on
banning trans children from playing sports. In addition to the deep sadness I
feel seeing adults and generally people in power making a great effort to
behave so cruelly to literal children, legislation that keeps trans children
from playing sports strikes a particularly painful nerve for me. Throughout my
life, sports have been a critical catalyst for developing self-esteem,
improving my mental health, and aiding emotional development, even in times
where outside messages told me to hate my body and myself. Depriving trans
children of an experience like this, one that could be incredibly affirming for
them in a world that may send them similar messages, is unconscionable.</p><p>A common refrain is that keeping trans people out of sports somehow protects
women’s sports, which is a laughably stupid, insulting, and ironic claim. It is
one I find especially worrying, as I hear it echoed in women&rsquo;s sports corners
of the internet that are usually quite progressive, and have even
heard repeated by other queer cis people in real life. It is worth
considering the source of this claim and who it benefits.
For one, this is the only time I have ever seen such a large group of people clamor
that women’s sports must be “protected.” Yet the <a href=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q1/overlooking-her-shot-womens-sports-need-an-assist-as-coverage-remains-the-same-as-30-years-ago.html>continued absence</a> of women’s
sports from sports media and other inequalities such as pay inequity, make
clear that women’s athletics have been and continue to be dramatically
undervalued and disrespected. Where have all these ostensible supporters of
women’s sports been until now? It is clear that the argument for
“protecting women’s sports&rsquo;&rsquo; is a thinly veiled disguise for blatant transphobia —
implying that trans women are not women — and paternalistic misogyny — no one
ever claims that men’s sports must be
protected from trans athletes. Instead transphobes (in power and otherwise)
hold up women’s sports as a faux-feminist beacon to convince supporters,
perhaps even ones who believe they support trans people, that somehow
discrimination (and abject cruelty) is a moral choice, and to suggest that
trans rights and women’s rights are mutually exclusive, when in fact they are
deeply connected. Trans people belong in sports, and all sports, including
women’s sports, are made better by being inclusive to everyone. I hope that
anyone who reads this with doubts about this idea considers my experience as a
pained child who was repeatedly told her body and gender expression were not
okay and how sports empowered me to love myself in spite of that.</p><p>Even better than hearing my story is listening to what trans athletes have to
say about their relationship with sports. I would encourage all cis people to
be curious about their experiences. Some of my favorite athletes are:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/arkangeljoy/?hl=en">Angel Flores</a>, a powerlifter and olympic weightlifter, who was featured in the
tv show <a href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80160037>Queer Eye</a> (Season 6, Episode 2). She wrote a great <a href=https://theoutfoundation.org/guest-blog-angel-flores>blog post</a> about her
experiences transitioning as an athlete, anchored to the perspective of what’s
going through her head during a powerlifting competition.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thechrismosier/?hl=en">Chris Mosier</a>, a triathlete and the first openly trans man to represent Team
USA, who was <a href=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/chris-mosier-on-making-history-as-first-trans-member-of-team-usa-250971/>profiled for Rolling Stone</a> in 2016 after qualifying. He runs
<a href=https://www.transathlete.com/>Transathlete</a>, “a resource for students, athletes, coaches, and administrators
to find information about trans inclusion in athletics at various levels of
play.” The site features a <a href=https://www.transathlete.com/take-action>page to take action</a> against legislation in the
United States targeting trans children in sports.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/janaemariekroc/?hl=en">Janae Marie Kroc</a>, a trans/nonbinary/genderfluid elite powerlifter and
bodybuilder. In this <a href=https://profilesinpride.com/janae-marie-kroc-on-being-transgender-athlete-in-the-spotlight/>interview</a> she discusses her experience transitioning as an
already well-known bodybuilder and powerlifter, as well as the documentary made
about her, <a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7935784/>Transformer</a>.</p></li></ul><p>After discovering olympic weightlifting as an adult, I affirmed how much sports
had really meant to me throughout my life, and I reclaimed an identity —
athlete — that I had been made to believe could not belong to me. Not
coincidentally, I began to wonder about the women’s sports magazine I had once
treasured so deeply. I acquired some issues and have enjoyed reading them again, in part for the fond memories and nostalgia. But I also
marvel at how ahead
of its time the publication feels. In sharp contrast to other women&rsquo;s magazines
of the time, particularly ones about fitness or health, <em>SI for Women</em>
glorified women for their athletic
achievements, repeatedly highlighted the importance of eating enough food to
fuel yourself for sports and health, and treated women’s sports
the way men&rsquo;s sports has always been treated. I also stumbled upon an almost
poetic discovery: Even though I only recall learning about the somewhat obscure
sport of olympic weightlifting a few years ago, <em>SI for Women</em> had been
covering it all along. Multiple issues feature a young <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Haworth>Cheryl
Haworth</a>, who
represented the United States in the first year weightlifting was opened to
women at the Olympics (2000) and won bronze at just 17 years old.</p><figure><img src=/cheryl.jpg alt="After Cheryl Haworth won bronze at the Sydney Olympics, SI Women featured her in a full page photo in the May/June 2000 issue.

Illustrated for Women</em>, and so far, I haven’t found another person who does.
So I decided that I wanted to share more about this gem of a magazine and my
connection to it with more of the world. I would love to show others what so
much of sport means to me, how important coverage of women’s sports is for
girls and women, and why we should care about making sport inclusive for
everyone. But mostly, I just love <em>Sports Illustrated for Women</em>, and I think
it would be fun to read it again, cover to cover, one more time.</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(o){var e,t,s,n=document.getElementsByTagName(o);for(t=0;t<n.length;t++)if(s=n[t],e=s.parentElement,e.childNodes.length===1){if(e.nodeName==="A"&&(e=e.parentElement,e.childNodes.length!=1))continue;e.nodeName==="P"&&(e.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr>Copyright 2022 Jordan P.
